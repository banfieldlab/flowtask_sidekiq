Riparian
========

Riparian is workflow system built with Delayed Job and Paperclip. It consists
of Flow Tasks, which are tasks to be performed by Delayed Job, and Flow Task
Resources, which constitute input and output data of the tasks. Flow Task
Resources can have an attached file, or a polymorphic relationship to an
ActiveRecord resource.

To make your own tasks, subclass FlowTask and implement the run method. Tasks
will be executed whenever Delayed Job gets to them.

If you need to alter Paperclip's path and url settings, you can add a
riparian.yml file to your config folder with the following settings:

  flow_task_resource_file_path: paperclip/interpolation/string
  flow_task_resource_file_url: paperclip/interpolation/string


Example
=======

class MyTask < FlowTask
  def run
    open(inputs.first.file.path) do |f|
      txt = f.read
      txt.gsub! 'foo', 'bar'
      Tempfile.open('bar') do |tf|
        tf.write(txt)
        outputs.create(:file => tf)
      end
    end
  end
end
